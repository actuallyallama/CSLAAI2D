## I would remove this repo as I clean up my GitHub account, however the language is on esolangs.org and was used on codegolf.stackexchange.com, so I shall leave it here. The code featured here does not reflect my current programming skill, as it is very old.


Running the EXE by dragging a file on it runs it.

Running the EXE on it's own prints the documentation. It'll be more up-to-date than the esolangs article.
